Today is the Wednesday of the next week. I should have written this weekly report last Sunday. However, I was focusing on something that I do not remember and hence postponed this report.

I planed to cancel this report as it is merely a task i gave to myself, and nobody is going to care about it. Nevertheless, it just hinders around in my mind and will not disappear. So, I decided to write it down anyway.

Just as I predicted, I started to use the forest as a tool to calculate the time. Even if it was counting down, I would not care about it anymore, tasks were left behind, and I went back to staying focus on what i am currently doing. The good part is that I stopped wasting my time, no matter what I am doing, it is always useful.

But still, I think it is better to follow the daily plan according to my Bujo, only in this way could i use the best out of my time. Meanwhile, if I do not follow my plan, I will just focus on the major tasks that are currently emergent and ignore those tasks that could do benefit me for the long term, like the memory palace, handwriting, reading, etc.

Another thing I have to condemn myself is that I didn't read enough paper as I required myself, anything could be postponed, but this paper reading, it is critical for my research career, I definitely can not put it easily and just let it go.

Talking about the gym, I stopped running in the morning as a friend of mine who is a fitness master told me that running wouldn't make my belly shrink, doing plank instead, so i did.

All right, let it be.
