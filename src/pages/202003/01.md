Honestly, I was surprised by how fast time flies, though I had thought about it many times, but until I record it in detail did I know its actual speed.

Time, the most precious thing in the world, the only thing that treats everybody equally, yet so easy to lose. It skips away, no matter how hard you try to seize it. It disappears at the same pace regardless of what you are doing. It will keep going even if the next second might be the last of so many. We all miss the past, cherish the present, yet expect the future. Well, if you believe you have one.

I still remember the time that I wrote my last weekly report, feels like it happened yesterday, I still have those thoughts in my mind, and what's worse, I still have the same progress out there. What did I do in the past seven days then?

Struggled very hard, though, I still could not stop myself from being controlled by procrastination. I knew this, even before I started this blog website, even before I started to use the Forest and BulletJournal, I knew I would be like this, that is exactly why I use those methods to stop myself or slow down the speed of myself of being lazy again. Well, failed but luckily not yet totally failed.

I can still get up at 6  in the morning; actually, I got up at 5 am today. Personal judgment: I am good at torturing myself, but not good at concentrating my mind. I could sit there for many days, exhausted without having the idea of giving up, but I could not focus on a single thing for too long. While I was studying, I will be distracted by all sorts of weird ideas easily and regularly. 

I set up my weekly goals through BuJo and finished most of them, though, I didn't finish the UC framework study and didn't figure out how to perform SEV communication.

As to my coming week, I have to first get up at precisely the time that I set and follow the routine that I planed last night.

But I should also give myself more free time to do a book reading and entertainment stuff and tighten that time little by little.
