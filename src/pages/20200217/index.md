I was about to share my first experience of driving alone yesterday, but end up with the week revew. And i planed to write it down today since it is a very big event for me since it has been 4 years sicne I got my driver's licence in China but out of fear I had never ever drived alone. A very meaningful experience to write down until I found an email from the conference where I submitted my very first paper, the paper that I modified until the last second, and ended up with that rejection letter. 

I got three reviewers working on my paper, thanks for their reviewing and suggestions. The first one gives me Reject directly while the rest two give me Weak Reject, well, full reject that means. How do I feel then, it is hard to say, a little bit disappinted
